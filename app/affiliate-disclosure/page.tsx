              The Maghreb Culinary Codex is an independent editorial archive. When a recipe
              page displays a “Shop this recipe” module, its product links may be affiliate
              links to relevant ingredients or cookware.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you follow an affiliate link and make a purchase, Oak and Main Developers LLC
              may earn a commission at no additional cost to you. A disclosure appears directly
              above those links, and product links are marked for search engines as sponsored.
            </p>
            <p>
              The archive remains available without using a product link. Affiliate
              relationships do not determine which recipe records are published, their source
              notes, or the accuracy and safety information shown in an entry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bibliographic and food-safety references in “Sources consulted” and
              “Cross-checked against” are provided for attribution and further reading. They do
              not use the affiliate tracking parameter used by optional shop modules.
