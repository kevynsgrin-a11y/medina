                The Maghreb Culinary Codex is an editorial collection of North African and
                related regional recipe records. It is designed to help readers explore dishes,
                techniques, source material, and regional variation. It is not a claim that every
                entry is a single definitive version of a living food tradition.

              <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl tracking-tight">Sources and attribution</h2>
              <p className="mt-3">
                Entries display source references and, where available, named sources consulted
                during editorial development. Source links are included for attribution and
                further reading. A source list does not turn an entry into a substitute for the
                original work, regional expertise, or independent kitchen testing.

              <p className="mt-3">
                Regional dishes have legitimate household, seasonal, and historical variation.
                When a record is an adaptation, an editorial reconstruction, or needs a food
                safety limitation, the entry&apos;s accuracy or safety note should say so. We avoid
                presenting unverified historical detail or a single recipe formula as universally
                authoritative.

                Recipe records are editorial information, not medical, nutritional, allergy, or

                food-safety guidance, and individual dietary needs before preparing or serving a
                dish. Follow linked government food-safety guidance where it is provided.
